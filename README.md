# portfolio
[This](https://kelsie-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) is a simple portfolio page that provides a little information about myself.  This project gave me the opportunity to use React, which is a trending library (or for some, framework) used by web programmers across the world.  The goal was to convert a much simpler version of this portfolio using this latest technology while experiencing the benefits of modular/component-based coding.
